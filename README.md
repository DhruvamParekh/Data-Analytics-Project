# Data-Analytics-Project---Classification-with-Python

I created a repository for my Data Analytics Project as part of a course at IIT Bombay

All experiments for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data manipulation and visualisation, implementation of the models and their evaluation are implemented using Python programming language.

In the notebook, I predict which customers are more likely to respond positively to a bank marketing call by setting up a regular savings deposit or subscribing the term “made_deposit”. 
Three classification algorithms will be developed in order to predict the target variable. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). 
The analysis of the project includes Data Summary, Data Preparation, Modelling, Results and Errors using Evaluation Metrics, Confusion Matrices and ROC Curve.
